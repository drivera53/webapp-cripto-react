# React - Flatcoin
Welcome to React - FlatCoin! This App was develop as a Flatiron School React project. I developed this app to help users practice trading cryptocurrencies using virtual (fake) money.

# Installation
You may fork this front end repository, but in order to work you need to fork its [back end repository](https://github.com/drivera53/webapp-cripto-rails-backend) as well.

# Usage
Run `rails s` on your back end to start the server. Then on this front end run: 
```ruby
npm install
```
Then start the server:
```ruby
npm start
```
Your app will run in `http://localhost:3000/` by default. The main page displays a list of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap and you can start trading right away. Keep in mind that you should have enough Buying Power in order to execute an order. Happy trading!
